## Specific Code Quality Observations

### Excellent Patterns Found:

1. **Proper async/await usage** throughout (lib/auth.ts)
2. **Consistent error handling** with try-catch blocks
3. **Type-safe API responses** with ApiResponse interface
4. **Clean component structure** with proper separation of concerns
5. **Environment variable usage** for configuration
6. **Proper use of Next.js features** (Server Components, API routes)
7. **Stripe Connect marketplace pattern** - sophisticated implementation

### Code Smells to Address:

1. **Hardcoded values**: Platform fee percentage could be configurable
2. **Missing pagination**: GET /api/bookings could return huge datasets

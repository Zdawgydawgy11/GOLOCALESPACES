## Technical Details

### Storage Setup

Images are stored in Supabase Storage in the `space-images` bucket. Make sure this bucket is created in your Supabase project:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard â†’ Storage
2. Create a bucket named `space-images`
3. Make it public (or configure RLS policies as needed)

### File Naming

Uploaded files are automatically renamed using this pattern:
```
{timestamp}-{randomString}.{originalExtension}
```

Example: `1698765432-abc123.jpg`

This prevents filename conflicts and makes files unique.

### Image Flow

1. User selects images â†’ Preview shown immediately
2. Form submitted â†’ Images uploaded to Supabase one by one
3. Public URLs received â†’ Saved with space listing
4. Space created with image URLs in database
